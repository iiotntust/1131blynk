# 1121powermeter update (Handson#2)
In this exercise, students learn how to use IoT platforms to build an IoT project.  
## Blynk QuickStart  
- Blynk.io https://blynk.io/
- Getting start: https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/what-do-i-need-to-blynk
- Support hardware:https://docs.blynk.io/en/getting-started/supported-boards
## Device D1 mini
- Microcontroller (Arduino compatible)
https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html
## DHT-11 (Humi/Temp sensor)
https://github.com/dhrubasaha08/DHT11
### Get start
1. Setting the environment:
- Download Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't forget to install CH340 driver
> - (download CH340 driver) https://www.arduined.eu/ch340-windows-10-driver-download/
> - (how to install) https://forum.arduino.cc/t/how-to-install-ch340-driver-for-windows-11/1154087  

Here is the wiring diagram:

> [!CAUTION]
> 5V -> (+)  
> G -> (-)  
> D4 -> out  
>  An incorrect wiring connection could result in the component being damaged by overheating.

![image](picture/15.png)  
##### Board setting
- Download ESP8266 from Tools -> Board -> board manager
![image](picture/16.png) 
##### Port setting
### Flash / Speed / Port
- Follow the setting from Board setting only red block you need to change.
> [!NOTE]
> Other settings are as same as default

#### Confirmation
> [!CAUTION]
> ![image](picture/17.png)  
> Please double check those 5 lines code are correct, otherwise D1 even cannot link to your WiFi

## Blynk
- Go to blynk website and sign up.
### Create template
#### Add new template.
![image](picture/12.png)  
- Enter the template's name.
Hardware choose ESP8266 and connection type is WiFi.
![image](picture/9.png)  
#### Go to datastreams
- Add new datastream and choose virtual pin
![image](picture/5.png) 
- Name can be HUMIDITY and TEMPERATURE, each name has it own PIN(for example is V5 and V6)
- Type is interger.
- Unit you can use percentage and degrees.
> [!NOTE]
> Because humidity is expressed as a percentage.
> So the range should be 0 to 100.

Like this.

- Drag two label to your dashboard.
![image](picture/2.png)  
- Click label's setting and change its name.  
![image](picture/6.png)  
- Choose the datastream you created and save.

#### Create device
- Go to device
- Add new device from template

> [!NOTE]
> At here, you can see your own token, you need this token and put in arduino D1.
> I suggest you copy first.(You also can find token in Developer tools)
